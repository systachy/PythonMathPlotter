# PythonMathPlotter

# 3D Calculus Graph Modeler

## Overview
This Python script provides a tool for visualizing mathematical functions in three dimensions. It uses `numpy` for numerical operations and `matplotlib` for creating interactive 3D surface plots.

## Features
- **Customizable Function Plotting:** Modify the function `f(x, y)` to visualize different mathematical expressions.
- **Interactive 3D Surface Plot:** Utilizes Matplotlib's 3D plotting capabilities to render surfaces.
- **Adjustable Domain:** Set the range and density of x and y values in the grid to suit specific needs.
- **Labeling and Color Mapping:** Each axis is labeled appropriately, and a colorbar is included to interpret the function values visually.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This script requires the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Modify the function `f(x, y)` in the script to the mathematical function you want to visualize.
2. Optionally, adjust the ranges of `x` and `y` to change the visualization domain.
3. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```
The plot will be displayed in an interactive window, allowing you to explore different angles and zoom levels.
